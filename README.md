#### ...because Data

- There's a **ton** of it and [more data will be generated in the next 2 years than the previous 5000 years of humanity](https://appdevelopermagazine.com/4773/2016/12/23/more-data-will-be-created-in-2017-than-the-previous-5,000-years-of-humanity-/)
    - Anyone wondering what kind of data they produced in 2983 BC?
    - Here's some [3000 BC stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30th_century_BC) just to get our minds around that statement...
        - [City of Troy Founded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy)
        - [They started building Stonehenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge)
        - [Earliest written language on Earth (Sumerian)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language)
- **Everyone** has it, produces it, uses it, and people want to learn from it
    - Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Target, and the NSA are *really* good at learning from it... that's how
        - Gmail filters your spam
        - Amazon recommends stuff for you to buy (that you didn't know you want)
        - Facebook autotags your photos
        - Netflix picks the right shows & movies
        - Target prints just the right coupons at checkout... ([How Target Figured Out A Teen Girl Was Pregnant Before Her Father Did](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#6afc1c6d6668))
- There are **so many** cool questions to answer
    - We finally have the data, skills, and tools
    - We just *don't* have enough people to work on them... ([a 2011 estimate endorsed by the US Govt (NIST) thinks we're short by about 190,000 with "deep analytical skills"](https://bigdatawg.nist.gov/pdf/MGI_big_data_full_report.pdf))
